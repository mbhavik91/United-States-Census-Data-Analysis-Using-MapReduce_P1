$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar workspace/Assignment3/dist/gigasort.jar cs455.gigasort.hadoop.MainJob /data/gigasort/unsorted-2 /home/output/final

Dataset Size = 19.9 GB

A shell script was developed to get the final results

The following commang was used to generate the hash value of each file
"openssl sha1 part-r-00006 | awk '{print $2}' >> hashvalue"

After that Generatehash.java was used to generate the finalHash in a recursive fashion

Merkle Tree Algorithm was used to generate the final hash value
